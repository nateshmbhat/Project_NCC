        <li >If the user has to add all candidate details to the main enrolment table of software's database, the excel sheet which is to be selected, must be generated in the <b>Query tab </b> with the <b>Select All</b> option <b>checked</b>.

        Once the user chooses the table corresponding to the excel spreadsheet , the data in the excel spreadsheet gets added to the database if the database already doesn't have the same enrolment numbers as in the selected spreadsheet. If the enrolment numbers in the excel sheet are already present in the database ,those enrolment numbers are not added to the database and hence ignored. In such a case, a <b>conflicts window</b> is shown listing all the Enrolment Numbers which are already in the database. The conflicts window looks as shown below.
